# Blog code

This repository contains example programs used to illustrate some articles on https://blog.tigris.fr/ that are not strictly about writing a Game Boy emulator (there is a [dedicated space](https://github.com/lazy-stripes/writing-an-emulator) for that).

(Some of those programs *might* still be Game boy-related.)
